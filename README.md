# Melanoma-Detection-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project aims to build a custom CNN model in TensorFlow to accurately detect melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. Early detection is crucial, and this model can potentially assist dermatologists by evaluating images and alerting them to possible melanoma presence.
